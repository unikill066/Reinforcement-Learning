# Reinforcement-Learning:

Reinforcement Learning is one of the 3 basic paradigms in ML alongside Supervised and Un-supervised Learning. RL is an area in machine learning concerned with how INTELLIGENT AGENTS ought to take ACTIONS in an ENVIRONMENT in order to maximize the notion of CUMULATIVE REWARDS. 


In RL, we focus on finding a balance between EXPLORATION (an uncharted territory) and EXPLOITATION (exploiting current known knowledge) enabling an AGENT(machine) to learn on its OWN in an interactive environment by trial and error. During the learning feedback is given in the form of rewards(positive/negative). 

 Terminologies of Reinforcement Learning: 

   AGENT 

   ACTION 

   ENV 

   REWARDS (+/-) 

   POLICY 

   STATE/ Observation 

   EPISODES 

An AGENT makes an ACTION by observing the current STATE of the ENVIRONMENT and in return gets REWARD (+/-). Based on the REWARDS, AGENT updates its POLICY which will be required to decide on the next ACTION.
